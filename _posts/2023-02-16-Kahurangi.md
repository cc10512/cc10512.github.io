It is mid-February and it is Summer: time for a tramping trip! So a group of 5 of us, colleagues and friends, decided to go for a 5-day trip to [Kahurangi National Park](https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/nelson-tasman/places/kahurangi-national-park/?tab-id=50578). Two of them had to pull out, but we decided that it's still worth going even in a smaller group. For the 5 days, we planned to do the Mount Arthur, the Tablelands, and Cobb Valley tracks (tracks is Kiwi-speak for trails).

Kahurangi National park was established in 1996 to protect the north-western corner of the South Island. Although much of the area was protected before, recognizing it as a park was a long time conservation effort. And from the little corner of it that we saw, it definitely paid off.  The area is a peaceful combination of mountains, beech forests, and high altitude plateaus (the Tablelands). It has some really cool geological features, including a multitude of sink holes, lakes. The grasses grow tall: there is no grazing in the park, so we walkied in grass sometimes taller than us.

Tramping is a hiking trip with overnight camping, either in huts or tents. Of course, with the [950 huts maintained by the DOC](https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-stay/stay-in-a-hut/about-doc-huts/) in New Zealand, carrying your tent seems unnecessary extra work. We definitely took advantage of the option. The basic idea was to get in one one side -- Flora car park, and get out from the other end of the trip -- Cobb Valley.

On the first day, we flew early morning to [Nelson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson,_New_Zealand), a little town of about 50,000 people at the North coast of the South Island (New Zealand is supposedly the country with the highest number of construction cones per capita -- they are everywere!). Given that this was the Thursday of the week when [Cyclon Gabrielle](https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/484213/widespread-damage-cyclone-gabrielle-in-pictures) battered New Zealand on Monday and Tuesday, we considered ourselves lucky that the weather was just overcast. The forecast for the next 5 days was very promissing -- what else would you expect? From Nelson we hired a ride with the [Heaphy Bus Company](https://theheaphybus.co.nz) to take us to the Flora car park. They offer a nice service and knowledgeable drivers. Craig, our driver for both the trip to the track and out at the other end, shared a lot of information about the tracks, the area, the history, and lots of other stories. We really enjoyed the company. We arrived at the trail head a little before noon.

**Side story**: we shared the ride with two young Americans from Massachussets who were there on a hunting/fishing trip. They had all the gear, including tents and food for about 10 days, and were planning to spend 20 days. When we arrived at the car park, they had their rifle on their sholder immediately. Even if it may have been just because they were leaving stuff (e.g., the gun case) with the driver, I did find it amusing how it reinforces the stereotype of Americans being gun loving!

We had a bit of a lunch and started our climb to Mount Arthur hut through a mossy beech forest.

The plan for the day was to drop our stuff at the hut and continue on the track to [Mount Arthur summit](https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/nelson-tasman/places/kahurangi-national-park/things-to-do/tracks/mount-arthur-summit/), and then return to the hut. And so we followed the plan. The weather was mostly overcast, with the sun occasionally breaking out of the clouds for some nice views.

On the way to the summit, it started raining, but we pushed forward since the rain was very light. I trusted that once we get to the summit, the rain will stop and the clouds will scatter. And that's exactly what happened.

On the way back to the hut, we actually got to see the mountain.

We arrived at the hut well before dark, cooked our dinner (polenta with cheese), talked a bit, and went to sleep. Mount Arthur hut has no electricity (some of the huts are equipped with solar panels and have led lights), and while we had headlamps and phones, we decided to call it a day early, especially given that the next day was a long one.

The next day started brilliantly!

The plan was to go on the [Tablelands](https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/nelson-tasman/places/kahurangi-national-park/things-to-do/tracks/tableland-circuit/) and link to Cobb Valley. For the day, we followed the track to Salisbury Lodge via Gordons Pyramid. This did imply that we track back toward Mount Arthur for three kilometers or so, but with the beautiful day ahead of us, we started with gusto.

It took us longer than planned, since the track was quite difficult, but we had the whole day, and we did reach Salisbury Lodge with time to spare. There were very few people on the mountain, on 7h of walking we met 3 people, even though the weather was good. It is true that it was a Friday.

At the lodge, we met again with Sarah, our fellow hut dweller from the Mount Arthur hut. She was hiking alone and twisted one of her knees, so was going to take it easy for the next couple of days. Even though one of our group members kept predicting twisted ankles, we managed to avoid it for the entire trip. Afterward she declared that this was the first trip in which no one got hurt, so we felt good about that -- not that this is something unusual about my trips. I am quite proud that there are very few eventful trips on my record :)

[Salisbury Lodge](https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/nelson-tasman/places/kahurangi-national-park/things-to-do/huts/salisbury-lodge/) deserves its "lodge" name. It is spacious, has solar panels and composting toilets, and feels like a hotel by comparison with other huts. We also met Peter, the warden taking care of the hut, who recommended some side trips, but we were just too tired and so, we cooked, washed, and went to sleep early again! Indeed, on this trip I caught up on sleep.

From Salisbury Lodge we took the track toward [Lake Peel](https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/nelson-tasman/places/kahurangi-national-park/things-to-do/tracks/lake-peel-tracks/) to get to Cobb valley. Another very peaceful and quiet day, with even less people than before.

The walk through Tablelands was amazing. Endless views with occasional old forest clumps. We started relatively early, as the fog was just breaking up, and you get these glimpses of peaks rising at the horizon, while you walk through grass, sometimes guessing where is the path, since the grass is so tall and dense!

We had lunch at Lake Peel, and then we reached the man made Cobb reservoir. The hut for the night, the [Trilobite hut](https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/nelson-tasman/places/kahurangi-national-park/things-to-do/huts/trilobite-hut/) is very close to the end of the lake.

Our plan for the next two days was to go up to [Fenella hut](https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/nelson-tasman/places/kahurangi-national-park/things-to-do/huts/fenella-hut/), do some side trips, and then the next day come down early to catch our ride back. However, none of our group felt keen on starting at 6am and lugging the packs down the valley to be back at Trilobite by 11am, so we decided to do the [Cobb Valley track](https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/nelson-tasman/places/kahurangi-national-park/things-to-do/tracks/cobb-valley-tracks/) in one day without the packs. It did make for a very long day, 28km of walking, but it was worth it. Cobb river valley has lots of water -- there is a stream almost every 50m. There are meadows full of grass, birds, and bugs.  This was a Saturday, so we did see _some_ people, maybe a dozen all together. There are huts spread out through the tracks, some more like a lean-to, built in the 1950s for prospecting and mining. Cobb himself was a miner.

We split from the track to Fenella before reaching the hut to go to Lake Cobb. An alpine lake, stashed between peaks, way too tempting to dip in, especially given all the [sandfly](https://www.health.govt.nz/your-health/healthy-living/environmental-health/pests-and-insects/sandflies) bites that I collected at the Trilobite hut!

Overall, another very peaceful day, lots of walking but thoroughly enjoyable.

Back at the Trilobite hut, we met a group of volunteers who take care of the traps spread around the park. As I mentioned previously, nature conservation in New Zealand is trying to restore the native habitat that did not include any mamals, so throughout the park there are traps for stouts, rats, and other mammalian pests.  The volunteers were all people in their 70s and 80s. Plenty of stories and experience. It was amazing to see how active they were and how dedicated to maintaining the ecosystem.

As for the last day, we did a small detour to the reservoir, waited for our shuttle, and got back to Nelson around 14:00. The airport has showers (very nice for an airport that doesn't really have gates!) and we took the opportunity to shed some of our accumulated grime.
