This weekend the weather was quite windy (40-50km/h) and cloudy. So we decided to stay around the city and explore one of its newest additions: [Te Ara ki Uta ki Tai](https://www.nzta.govt.nz/about-us/news-and-media/video-gallery/exploring-te-ara-ki-uta-ki-tai-glen-innes-to-tamaki-drive-shared-path/).

The path is a shared use track for both pedestrians and cyclists. It is an exquisite build, a wide path winding through nature in the middle of the city!

It crosses Orakei Bay as a bridge and you walk over water with unencumbered views of the bay.

After that, it becomes a concrete path through native plants, next to Pourewa Creek and horse farms. What surprised us most was how quiet it is. We expected a lot more people to take advantage of it. In addition, we were fortunate enough that the Eastern train line is undergoing maintenance (they are replacing the tracks!) so for the next few months, there are also no trains running to disturb the peace.

Birds, horses, and lush vegetation dot the landscape.

And [Maori pouwhenua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pouwhenua) protect the path.

In the end, a really enjoyable 10km walk.
