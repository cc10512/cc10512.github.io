We are still getting used to the idea of Christmas in the middle of the summer. Not that the customs make it any easier -- all the Christmas cheer is still driven by the Northern Hemisphere, with snow, frost, sleighs, Santa dressed up for winter, and so on and so forth.

But here in Auckland, Christmas is Pōhutukawa trees in full bloom, time at the beach, or around the neighborhood. And in that light, the other day we went for a walk from home to the top of [Mount Hobson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ōhinerau_/_Mount_Hobson). It's a short walk, roughly 7km return, especially when you cut it through the bay at low tide.

The weather was leaning toward rain -- otherwise we would have been to the beach. It was perfect for a walk, a bit windy to cool us off. We caught a few drops, however, the clouds made it up for some nice shots. Especially from the top of the mountain, with its 360° views.

Not much more to explain, enjoy the photos.
