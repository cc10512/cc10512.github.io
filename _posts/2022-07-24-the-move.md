Moving house across continents is not an easy feat: although we took the opportunity
to somewhat slim down when we moved houses in Oct. 2020, it was too easy to just
pile everything and take it when we moved one mile across town! This time however, we
agreed that it makes sense to haul only the minimum number of things we want to
keep. We'll be moving withing New Zealand as well until we find our place, and
really, do we need to keep the paper credit card statements from the '90s?

We contacted a few companies for moving and their first question was "what inventory
are you moving?". So we sat down with a spreadsheet and sorted through our _stuff_:
things we move, things we keep, and things we let go. For all the papers, we went
full digital, so both our scanners did extra duty for a few months! Same thing with
our collection of photos and films. As for letting go of other things ... not so
easy. Anca has quite a number of stories to tell from talking to charities and other
organizations that are geared toward helping the homeless but take only new stuff.
What finally worked was a combination of charities, neighborhood groups such as [Buy
Nothing](https://www.facebook.com/BuyNothingProject/){:target="_blank"} and [Free
Cycle](https://www.freecycle.org/town/PaloAltoCA){:target="_blank"}, and Facebook
marketplace -- turns out that for somethings you just have to put a price on in
order to get attention! Electrical appliances outside computers rarely support dual
voltages (New Zealand has 240V/50Hz) which meant that we needed to find a home for
most of the kitchen appliances, printers, scanners, and power tools. Although one
can get a voltage transformer, but at the number of such appliances we had, we're
talking a whole family of transformers, some of them requiring significant power.
For example, Anca's Vitamix blender draws (... by now, was drawing!) 1400W. We ended
up taking the Instapot, because online research showed that the ones available in NZ
are either the US version or shipped from the US, and we divested of the rest.
Although, while in Auckland, we found out that the Instapot US shipped version is a
240V one -- yet another reminder to take the information posted on the Internet with
a grain of salt!

We kept unloading before the movers came, and then they loaded all the stuff we said
we'll take, and we were still left with half a house full of things! In the end, it
was Anca's friends from the garden club who stepped in and helped us clean up
everything else. Thank you Ann, Allen, and Katia!

It has been our plan all along to fly out from Seattle and spend some time with Dan
and Parley before leaving. And thus, after yet another day of sorting, packing, and
cleaning, we packed a car + trailer full of luggage (skis and boots included!) and
stuff, and started toward Seattle.

We detoured through Sacramento to drop a few things for a friend and we were bummed
that at 8pm it was still 96℉ (35.5℃ -- yes, we're moving back to the metric system)!
The heat wave continued for the next couple of days until we reached Vancouver, WA.

And so we spent 10 days in Seattle, visiting with Dan, continuing to pack and
re-pack our bags to at least attempt to fit airline limits, and selling our car --
which was an adventure on its own right. New Zealand drives on the left, so
importing cars requires to refit them with the wheel on the right hand side -- a
very expensive proposition. Later, I also read that they impose additional taxes on
diesel cars. Why? Beats me, because diesel engines are more efficient than gasoline
-- our car overall mileage was around 40mpg, and with the proper catalytic
convertors in place, generate the same level of pollution. After all, it broke my
heart, but put it up for sale on Craig's list. Interestingly, I had a couple of
people who reached out saying that this would be their dream car! Unfortunately,
none of them came through and we closed the transaction with a wholesaler.

We kayaked on Union Lake,

Deception Pass State Park,

Ballard Locks.

Beside a few days of working remotely and my regrets that I can not keep the car, these past few days really felt as a vacation!

And off we are!

Obviously not on a boat, but to the West :)
